# A card game

You have a deck of $n$ cards with face values $1, \ldots, n$, out with you pick $m$ cards u.a.r. without replacement. You want to know what is the probability that there are at least $m - 1$ cards whose face values are consecutive among the $m$ that you picked.

## Input
  The first line of the input contains the number $t \leq 10$ of test cases.
  Each of the $t$ test cases is described as follows.
  
  - It consists of a single line containing two integers $\verb|n m|$,
      separated by a space, denoting the total number of cards ($4 \leq n \leq
      20)$, the number of cards you pick ($4 \leq m \leq n$). 

## Output
  For each test case output one line containing a real number denoting the
  probability that among the $m$ cards you picked u.a.r. there are at least $m - 1$ consecutive ones. Your
  solution is going to be accepted if it has an absolute or relative error of at
  most $10^{-6}$.

## Points
  This exercise gives $100$ points (no bonus points!).
